    <div class="introduction">
      I, Kwon Ko, declare that I live, think, and act based on the following life principles:
    </div>

    <section>
      <h2>Meaning</h2>
      <p>I acknowledge my mortality and find meaning of life not in pursuing goals, but dreams: to identify and solve
        the most important problems that confer the greatest benefit to humankind. My contributions stem from rigorous
        reasoning grounded in new materialism, pragmatism, and existentialism. I always aim to maximize their impact on
        the greater good.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Focus</h2>
      <p>I hold self-actualization as my highest priority, even over matters required for sustaining my own safety. I
        devote all my energy and time to this end. I am willing to persevere for it even at the risk of losing
        everything I possess. I am never discouraged by any hardships that I encounter throughout my life. I do not
        compromise and remain consistent, refusing to be distracted by money, societal honor, fame, popularity, or
        desire.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Value</h2>
      <p>I strive to earn objective respect from future generations by learning, growing, and improving everyday upon
        who I was yesterday. I take responsilibity for my words and actions, and have the courage to forgive, apologize,
        and let go when necessary, even as fear stands near. I actively participate in communities of practice,
        treating all individuals with dignity, free from bias based on appearance, religion, age, race, gender, sexual
        orientation, political beliefs, or socioeconomic status. I understand people through direct interaction, not
        through secondhand information. I respect societal norms and systems while evaluating the broader impact of my
        actions.</p>
    </section>

    <div class="closing">
      As I learn and grow, I will refine this creed, but my commitment to humanity and love for society will never
      change.
